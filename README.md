## Parallax MS5607 Altimeter Logger using Arduino-LabVIEW

This purpose of this development exercise was to create a data logging application for the [Parallax MS5607 Altimeter Module](https://www.parallax.com/product/29124). The altimeter module is a breakout board for the [MS5607-02BA03 Barometric Pressure Sensor](https://www.te.com/commerce/DocumentDelivery/DDEController?Action=showdoc&DocId=Data+Sheet%7FMS5607-02BA03%7FB2%7Fpdf%7FEnglish%7FENG_DS_MS5607-02BA03_B2.pdf%7FCAT-BLPS0035) offered by TE Connectivity. The sensor provides pressure and temperature data over an I2C bus that is acquired through ab Arduino and displayed on a PC using LabVIEW.
